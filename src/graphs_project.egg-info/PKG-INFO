# graphs-project
Graph repo with implementation of its own graph library to solve a modeled problem.

## Features

### Graph Representations

- **Adjacency Matrix**  
  A 2D matrix where cell `[i][j]` represents the presence (and optionally the weight) of an edge between vertices `i` and `j`.

- **Adjacency List**  
  A dictionary-based structure where each vertex maps to a list of adjacent vertices (and optionally the weights or labels of edges).

### Core Functionality

The library supports a range of basic and advanced graph operations:

- **Graph Creation**
  - Create a graph with a user-defined number of vertices

- **Edge Manipulation**
  - Add and remove edges

- **Vertex and Edge Labeling**
  - Assign weights and labels to vertices
  - Assign weights and labels to edges

- **Adjacency Checks**
  - Check adjacency between two vertices
  - Check adjacency between two edges

- **Incidence Checks**
  - Verify if an edge is incident to a vertex
